Python is an object oriented language:
    object - collection of data (variables) and methods (functions) that act on those data
             - method uses data as a blueprint

Classes allow you to make custom objects that contain attributes (finer details) and methods (functions)

what is self?
self represents the instance of a class 
    - instance is a form of an object(modified version of a class)

HOW TO MODIFY CLASS

class Song:
    def song_name(self, name):
        self.name = name
    this function gets the name of the song

    def get_song():
        return self.name
    this function returns whatever you set the name of the song as

s = Song()
this stores the class into a variable

s.song_name("song name")
this changes the title of the song to whatever you put in the string

print(s.song_name())
this calls the function from inside of the class
