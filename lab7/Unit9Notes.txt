Classes are like cookie cutters,
objects are "instances" (finer details) of classes

example: person is a class, Arvin is an object
         dog is a class, Finn is an object

Python itself is shipped with many pre defined classes
for instance, 'String' is a class. Integer is a class. Float is class. Etc...

a = 5.2 --> a is an instance of a 'Float' class with a value of 5.2

an object has functions, variable, and data
a person class can have DOB, address, name as variable templates
a person class can have get_age() as a function definition 

in order to maintain large programs, it is important we categorize code into
classes which encapsulates logic of operations for that single class.

Classes helps you organize your code better.
